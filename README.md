# Smart Housing: Enhancing Security Through License Plate Recognition 🚗🏡

This repository contains the research paper, report, and code implementation for the project titled **"Smart Housing: Enhancing Security Through License Plate Recognition."** Our project leverages machine learning, image processing, and database integration to create a secure and automated vehicular access control system for housing societies.

## 🌟 **Project Overview**

With the rise in security concerns, gated communities and housing societies require robust systems to manage vehicular access. Traditional methods involving manual intervention are prone to inefficiencies and errors.  

Our project introduces an **automated License Plate Recognition (LPR) system** that enhances security while streamlining the vehicle entry process. By combining image processing and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), this system identifies authorized vehicles and grants them access seamlessly.

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Real-Time License Plate Detection:** Captures and processes vehicle license plates in real-time.
- **Text Extraction with OCR:** Extracts alphanumeric text using Tesseract OCR.
- **Database Integration:** Verifies vehicles against a pre-existing database of authorized entries.
- **Automated Access Control:** Flags unauthorized vehicles and grants/denies access accordingly.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle diverse environmental conditions and multiple entry points.
